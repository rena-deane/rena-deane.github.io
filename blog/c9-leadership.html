              <h4>Leadership</h4>
              <h5>Compasionate Leadership</h5>
                <p>
                  If I was to look back and examine whether I've had any experience with compassionate leadership I would first look at the three components of compassion.
                </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      A cognitive component: "I understand you"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An affective component: "I feel for you"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A motivational component: "I want to help you"
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                <p>
                  In many situations where I've engaged with friends or co-workers I think I've displayed compassion but whether that translates to me being a Level 5 leader, I don't know.  I personally think at the moment I fall short when it comes to sustaining ambition.  But with the right frame of mind it can be achieved.  Fully adopting the three comps will create the conditions to be a Level 5 Leader. 
                </p>

              <h5>Multiplying Goodness</h5>
                <p>
                  Love, compassion, altruism and inner joy.  Haven't practiced this yet but I like the benefits.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Seeing goodness in self and others</li>
                  <li>Giving goodness to all</li>
                  <li>Confidence in the transformative power of self - I can multiply goodness</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  I need to summarise all the different practices because there a way too many and they all overlap.
                </p>

                <h5>Tonglen Meditation</h5>
                  <p>
                    The main principle, breathing in pain and suffering, is something that up until this point I didn't realise I had been doing.  However I've yet to transform it in to acceptance, joy, ease and light/radiance.  Without it you can feel totally overwhelmed with emotion but this practice certainly eases the tension within.
                  </p>

                <h5>Phase-0 SCARF</h5>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Status:</strong> I feel as though I'm on the same level as everyone else in my cohort.  I'm going in to this with the mindset that we all have various things to learn and share.  Compared to where I was 12-weeks ago, at the bottom of the food chain, to now I reckon I'm moving on up.  But the fact that I'm a bit hesitant to ask all of EDA for help via Slack indicates to me that I feel like a rookie amongst pros.  I have to get over that because I wont learn if I don't seek help from those with experience.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Certainty:</strong> Feeling abit uncertain at the moment because I still need to learn a few more things heading in to bootcamp on Monday.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Autonomy:</strong> The one time where I felt complete helplessness was during the first phase of the Racer Car Game.  I was completely lost and stressed out.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Relatedness:</strong> Do I walk by people on a street and consider them a friend?  Probably not.  So when I interacted with my cohort and people at EDA I didn't assume "ah yes all these people are my friends".  But I wouldn't say they were my foes.  Once I get to know everyone I hope we become friends.  Better revise this book then.  
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Fairness:</strong> The only experience of fairness I can think of during was Phase-0 was the pairing sessions.  I think understanding was also key.  If one had to leave early, sharing the workload.  It's a balance for sure.
                  </p>

                <h5>Difficult Conversation</h5>
                  <p>
                    I don't have anyone to have a conversation with.  I feel that writing it out prepares you well for dialogue but underestimates the emotion of the conversation.

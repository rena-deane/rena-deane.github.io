          <h6>Grid Based Design</h6>
              <p>The grid based design is a CSS framework used to arrange web content into rows and columns.  Every webpage is based on some type of grid design.  The most common grid size is 12 columns.</p>
          <h6>Responsive Webpages</h6>
              <p>People access the web using devices that vary in size/resolution.  Responsive design allows a page to respond to the changing size of a web browser meaning that if the browser width is reduced the content responds so that it fits within the browser's boundaries.</p>
          <h6>Semantic Structure</h6>
              <p>Semantic tags are used so that users such as developers and the web can easily determine the infromation structure of a webpage.  For example, <code>h1</code> to <code>h6</code> for headings, <code>img</code> for images and <code>forms</code> for forms.  These tags aren't about visual styling.  For instance, screen readers/assistive technology focus on semantic structures to read the page to a visually impaired user.</p>
          <h6>Interesting Points</h6>
              <ul>
                <li>Grid - I found the <code>.classnames</code> for the 12 column grid very helpful.  This takes the stress out sectioning a page using div tags and creating names for the class attributes.</li>
                <li>Overflow - I like how a bunch of text can be contained in an area of the page.</li>
                <li><code>@media</code> - I look forward to learning more about responsive design.</li>
                <li>Code, Test, Refine - This cycle reaffirms the method i've been applying.  Chrome dev tools is fun to use when testing code and trying out new ideas.  Also I always keep in the back of my mind to firstly determine the layout and secondly, customise</li>
                <li>Font - linking to google fonts is fun and gives us better design choices.</li>
              </ul>

    <h3>Time and Habit Techniques</h3>
    <h4>Friday 16 March 2016</h4>
        <p>Time always slips away from me when I'm not aware of it.  So using tools such as Toggle forces me to take note of the time spent on challenges.  When it's not suggested in the waffle assignments section, I have to learn to allocate time to bits of work.  I only work on bits of the assignment, not the whole thing at one, but I don't allocate time for each piece. Up until this point I've been timing how long it takes for me to do a task rather then setting a time to do the task.  Pretty much what not to do in this course!  So now, I'm starting to use the tomato technique (Pomodoro).  I haven't figured out how to do that using Toggle or if that's even possible so I'm using my iPhone Clock - Timer.</p>

        <p>What I found interesting was the Counterintuitive-productivity method.  I especially like the line, <em> People don't procrastinate because they're lazy.  People procrastinate as a self-defense mechanism against doing stuff they despise or doing things too mechanically.</em>  Something I wish I read while I was at university</p> 

        <p>Meditation is something I truly believe in but don't practice enough.  So the tiny habbit I've created based on the Fogg method is <em>before I start a new waffle assignment I will sit quietly with my eyes closed for two minutes.</em>  I've only done it 1 out of 4 times.  So it's something I'm working on.</p>

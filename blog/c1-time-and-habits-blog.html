    <h3>Time and Habit Techniques</h3>
      <h5>Friday 16 March 2016</h5>
          <p>Time always slips away from me when I'm not aware of it.  So using tools such as Toggle forces me to take note of the time spent on challenges.  When it's not suggested in a waffle, I have to learn to allocate time to sections of the assignment.  I try not to do the whole waffle at once, but I also don't allocate time for each piece. Up until this point I've been timing how long it takes me to do a task rather than setting a time to do the task.  Pretty much what not to do in this course!  So now, I'm starting to use the tomato technique (Pomodoro).  I haven't gone through the six-step process yet.  I've started by using my iPhone Clock - Timer and allocate 25 minutes to sections within a waffle assignment.  So far so good, and I can use the 5 minute break to make my son a jam sandwich.</p>

          <p>What I found interesting was the Counterintuitive-productivity method.  I especially like the line, <em> People don't procrastinate because they're lazy.  People procrastinate as a self-defense mechanism against doing stuff they despise or doing things too mechanically.</em>  Something I wish I read and recognised while I was at university.  Coming from the ultimate procrastinator.  A habit I am quickly growing out of.</p> 

          <p>Meditation is something I truly believe in but don't practice enough.  So the tiny habbit I've created based on the Fogg method is <em>before I start a new waffle assignment I will sit quietly with my eyes closed for two minutes.</em>  I've only done it 1 out of 4 times.  So.... it's something I'm working on.</p>

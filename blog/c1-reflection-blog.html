    <h3>EDA Experience</h3>
      <p>This is my second opportunity to learn aspects of web development.  My first experience was quite unpleasent.  At university I studied information systems and wanted to pursue e-commerce.  Once we got in to the development side of things I was excited but ended up dropping out of that major because I was out of my depth and I didn't know how to ask for help.  And when I did ask for help, no one was willing to provide it or it felt like an inconvinience.  So I was put off all things web design/development.
      </p>
      
      <p>Listetning to Shereef and reading up on EDA I feel confident that this experience and environment will be alot different as it sounds like a safe and thrilling place to learn and hopefully thrive.
      </p>
      
      <p>What excites me the most about EDA is that it's a new way of working that I've never experienced.  I've worked in the public sector for a total of two years and in-between a stay at home mum.  I grew up in te ao Maori so to see so many similarities between my culture and EDA's culture is awesome.  I've summed them up in 3 <em>tanga's</em>.
        <ol>
          <li>Manaakitanga - To encourage helping and sharing.  Doing your best to provide everyone with the best resources and information available to feed them well.  Mind, body and soul.</li>
          <li>Kotahitanga - Encourage collaboration, co-operation to work together and support each other.</li>
          <li>Rangatiratanga - Literally meaning self governance. Whilst working together, us as inviduals have to manage ourselves so that we achieve all challenges set out before us.</li>
        </ol>
      
      <p>
      What makes me nervous is the unknown and actually being honest about my capabilities so that I don't fall in to the same trap as last time.  Besides basic HTML and CSS everything is foreign to me.  Also, the course will only get more intense which takes me away from my 2 year old boy.  So I'm going to work my *explitive* off and remember that the time spent away from whanau is a short term sacrifice for long term gain.  I also need to keep reminding myself to ask for help, whether it's Google, my teachers or my awesome cohort!

      <p>Thanks for reading my reflection novel.</p>

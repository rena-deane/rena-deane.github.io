        <h5>Chapter 1</h6>
        <p>
          Reading and watching chapter 1 makes me want to learn about improving my emotional competencies.  Being aware that these exist make it more realistic to achieve the state of being.  I find myself either thinking about the past and future and forget live in the present.  Through mindfulness it's exciting to know I can train myself to switch into a state of calmness and clarity on demand.  It sounds simple and almost too good to be true.  I think the challenge is to keep practising.  The habit I created for myself is similar to the 2 minutes of mindfulness.  I challenged myself to sit for 2 minutes with my eyes closed, silent, before I started a waffle ticket.  I think I should tweek it to be 2 minutes before every meal.  My silent prayer.

          Another interesting lesson was the one about attention.  Recognising what your body is trying to tell you without judgement.

          I found the two minutes of mindfulness very soothing and relaxing.  I found myself switching between the <em>Easy Way</em> and the <em>Easier Way</em>.  The two minutes went by very fast and it gave me a little energy burst.  I think it has a similar effect to the power nap.

          I'm very keen on this book and its teachings and excited about the positive effects it will have on me.  I look forward to reading the rest of the book.

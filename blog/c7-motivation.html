              <h4>Motivation</h4>
                <h5>Pleasure, Passion and Purpose</h5>
                  <p>
                    Knowing that there are three types of hapiness, Triple P, I wondered which P I was chasing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pleasure, the first P, described my current behaviour.  Always chasing "the next high" - helping my son do something he's never done before, actually going for a walk (exercise not leisurely), food, watching my favourite teams win at their respective sport, having a good laugh with family and friends.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've experiened the state of flow, also known as the second P - Passion, when completing some of our assignments.  I also enjoy design and video editing.  When I've planned well or have an a-ha moment where I just know what to do I find myself in that state where times goes by so fast and I'm fully engaged. Also, when I'm cleaning the house. when I'm on a roll you can't stop me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I started this course I was super happy and still am to this day.  I'm studying something I chose and that I'm passionate about.  There are two things that give me that sense of purpse.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      I plan to give back to my small community on the East Coast it also gives me a sense of purpose.  My community doesn't have many employment opportunities but we do have internet.  It's evident that being online exposes you to a larger market, no matter what you do.  I want to be an example to our young ones and show them that Web Development is a great opportunity.  Maybe one day, teach them Web Development.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ultimately, I'm pursuing Web Development so I get to spend more time with my son and eventually move back home.  If I can build my skill base and reputation I can have more control over when and where I can work.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    Looking at life through this lense puts what I do in perspective in a sense that it prioritises what I do.
                  </p>
                <h5>Core values to stand on</h5>
                <blockquote cite=>
                    <p>"You is kind, you is smart, you is important."</p>
                    <p id="author-quote">Kathryn Stockett, The Help</p>
                  </blockquote>  
                <p>
                  <strong>Kindness</strong> - I strive to be kind to everyone I engage with without judgement.  Like smiling, I believe it is contagious so when I'm kind to someone it's almost like paying it forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Honesty</strong> - also a virtue as I strive to be more honest.  Not in the sense of not lying, but not ignoring a situation that requires you to be upfront and honest.  Not being affraid to say something eventhough you may not be popular afterwards.  When I'm honest I also remember to be kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Integrity</strong> - I set high standards for myself and do my best to stick with them no matter what the situation.  Standing up for what I believe in can be tricky and very exhausting.  So I have to be courageuos and choose which battles to fight. I choose to remain dedicated and self-controlled through challenging situations.  I also have to be resilient and learn from my mistakes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Creativity</strong> - I believe everyone has the right and is capable of being creative.  I believe creativity is an outlet of freedom of thought and expression and goes hand in hand with innovation and passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Intention</strong> - I learnt that every choice produces a consequence.  So with everything I do, I have to be honest in what my deepest intentions are.  Ask myself, "What is your intention?".  Truly ask myself and be honest about it.
                </p>
              <h5>Resilience</h5>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>"Think of happiness as a deep ocean.  The surface may be choppy but the bottom is always calm"</p>
                  <p id="author-quote">Matthieu Ricard</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  To get to where you're going you need resilience.  We make our best decisions when we're calm and thinking clearly.  We train our resilience but accessing inner calm, emotional resilience and cognitive resilience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For me it all relys on being calm.  This is what I practice through mindful meditation.
